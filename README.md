    2. Originally was going to use a Amazon price API, but  all of them require credit card info upfront, even for the FREEMIUM models. So I manually scraped the data from Amazon and the Crunchyroll store, alongside using Keepa ( which keeps track of historically low prices ). All prices are based off of new condition books, sold by the following official retailers: Amazon, Crunchyroll, and RightstufAnime -- which has since been accquired by Crunchyroll.
