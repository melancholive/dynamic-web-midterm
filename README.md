# MIDTERM
    Manga Information and Price Tracker

# Sources of Data:
    1. https://jikan.moe/ -- 
    2. Originally was going to use a Amazon price API, 
    but all of them require credit card info upfront, even for the FREEMIUM models. 
    So I manually scraped the data from Amazon and the Crunchyroll store, 
    alongside using Keepa ( which keeps track of historically low prices ). 
    All prices are based off of new condition books, sold by the following official retailers: 
    Amazon, Crunchyroll, and RightstufAnime -- which has since been accquired by Crunchyroll.

# Interactive UI:
    - Clicking on the titles in the header brings you to the page
    with info and price of the corredponsing manga.

# UI Change Based off Data:
    - The icon for the status of a series changes depending on whether it is publishing or completed.
