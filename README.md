    Manga Information and Price Tracker

# APIS USED:
    1. https://jikan.moe/ -- 
    2. Originally was going to use a Amazon price API, 
    but all of them require credit card info upfront, even for the FREEMIUM models. 
    So I manually scraped the data from Amazon and the Crunchyroll store, 
    alongside using Keepa ( which keeps track of historically low prices ). 
    All prices are based off of new condition books, sold by the following official retailers: 
    Amazon, Crunchyroll, and RightstufAnime -- which has since been accquired by Crunchyroll.
